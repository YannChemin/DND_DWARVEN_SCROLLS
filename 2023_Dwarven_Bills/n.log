I've just read as much of that statement as I could fathom,
so a semicolon should have been next. It's very puzzling...
but I'll try to get myself back together, by ignoring
everything up to the next `;'. Please insert a semicolon
now in front of anything that you don't want me to delete.
(See Chapter 27 of The METAFONTbook for an example.)

That macro has more parameters than you thought.
I'll continue by pretending that each missing argument
is either zero or null.

I can't set an internal quantity to anything but a known
numeric value, so I'll have to ignore this assignment.
